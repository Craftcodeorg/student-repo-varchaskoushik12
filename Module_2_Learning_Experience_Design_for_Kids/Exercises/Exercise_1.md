### Module Title: Learning Experience Design for Kids

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement
**Scenario**: You are tasked with creating an educational game that teaches kids aged 8-15 the basics of coding through storytelling. The game will involve a character that navigates through different levels of a storybook world, where each decision made by the player affects the outcome of the story. 

**Task**: Create a storyboard for this educational game that outlines the following:
- The main character and their goals.
- Key story elements and how they relate to coding concepts (e.g., variables, loops, conditionals).
- Different levels or scenes in the game and the coding challenges presented in each.
- How feedback will be provided to players as they progress.

This exercise promotes critical thinking by requiring you to apply the principles of Learning Experience Design (LXD) discussed in the lecture, particularly focusing on learner-centered design and engagement through interactivity.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
Below is a starter code snippet that relates to your game design. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality of the character's movement in the game based on player decisions.

```python
# Starter code for implementing character movement in the story
def move_character(direction):
    # Define possible directions
    possible_directions = ["forward", "backward", "left", "right"]
    
    # Check if the direction is valid
    if direction in possible_directions:
        # Move character based on direction
        print(f"The character moves {_______} in the story!")
    else:
        print("Invalid direction! Please choose from forward, backward, left, or right.")

# Test the function with example values
move_character("_______")
```

#### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1**: Think about what you want to say when the character moves. What word fits in the blank that describes the action?
- **Hint 2**: Ensure that your test call to `move_character` uses a valid direction from the list defined in your function.
- **Hint 3**: Consider how you might expand this function later to include different outcomes based on other coding concepts learned during the lecture.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Fill in the blanks correctly to demonstrate your understanding of how to implement character movement based on user input.
- Show your grasp of storytelling elements by creating a narrative that connects coding concepts with engaging gameplay.
- Write well-commented code that explains each step, adhering to best practices and incorporating error handling where necessary.

### Integration
This exercise is structured to facilitate easy integration into your learning platform. Ensure that you follow the format provided, using markdown for clarity and including any necessary resources or references as needed. 

### Conclusion
By completing this exercise, you will not only develop your skills in Learning Experience Design but also create a foundational storyboard for an educational game that can captivate young learners while teaching them essential coding concepts.
