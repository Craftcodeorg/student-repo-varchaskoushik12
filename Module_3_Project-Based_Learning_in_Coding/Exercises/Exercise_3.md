### Module Title: Project-Based Learning in Coding

### Exercise Requirements

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   Design a prototype for a coding project aimed at kids that incorporates storytelling elements to enhance engagement and learning. The project should involve creating an interactive story-based game where players make decisions that affect the outcome of the story. Utilize the steps discussed in the lecture to outline your project goals, framework, and collaborative aspects.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**:
   Below is a starter code for your interactive story-based game. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality, ensuring to follow the storytelling techniques discussed in the lecture.

   ```python
   # Starter code for an interactive story-based game
   def start_adventure():
       print("You are in a dark forest. Do you go left or right?")
       choice = input("Type 'left' or 'right': ")
       if choice == 'left':
           # Continue the adventure on the left path
           print("You find a treasure chest! What do you want to do?")
           action = input("Type 'open' to open the chest or 'leave' to walk away: ")
           if action == 'open':
               print("You found a magical sword!")
           else:
               print("You walk away safely.")
       elif choice == 'right':
           # Continue the adventure on the right path
           print("You encounter a wild animal! What do you want to do?")
           action = input("Type 'run' to escape or 'stay' to confront it: ")
           if action == 'run':
               print("You escaped safely!")
           else:
               print("The animal is friendly and guides you home.")
       else:
           print("Invalid choice! Please type 'left' or 'right'.")

   start_adventure()
   ```

3. **Hints**:
   - Think about how each decision can lead to different outcomes in your story. This can help you create branching paths for players.
   - Use clear and engaging language when presenting choices to capture the attention of young learners.
   - Consider how you can incorporate educational elements into the story, such as math problems or coding concepts that need to be solved to progress.

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   By completing this exercise, students will demonstrate their understanding of how to create an interactive narrative through coding. The final solution should effectively utilize storytelling techniques and include appropriate error handling. Students should comment on their code to explain their reasoning and decisions made during the development process, aligning with best practices emphasized in the lecture.

### Integration
- Ensure that all sections of this exercise are clearly marked with headings for easy navigation.
- Use markdown formatting for clarity and include any additional resources or links relevant to project-based learning and storytelling in coding education. 

This exercise aligns with your goals of creating captivating educational content for kids aged 8-15, enhancing their coding skills through engaging storytelling and interactive experiences.
