# Module Title: Project-Based Learning in Coding

## Exercise Requirements

### 1. Problem Statement
As a tutor for kids aged 8-15, you are tasked with designing an engaging coding project that incorporates storytelling elements to teach fundamental coding concepts. Your goal is to brainstorm project ideas that can be executed using a coding platform like Scratch or Python, ensuring that the projects are both educational and captivating for young learners.

**Scenario**: Imagine you have a group of students who are excited about coding but have little experience. They love stories and games, and your challenge is to create a project that combines these elements to teach them basic programming concepts.

**Task**: Brainstorm at least three project ideas that utilize storytelling to teach coding concepts. Each idea should include:
- The main storyline or theme.
- The coding concepts that will be taught.
- How students will collaborate and reflect on their learning.

### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
Hereâ€™s a simple starter code for a storytelling project in Python. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality of the program that tells a story based on user input.

```python
# Starter code for an interactive storytelling project
def tell_story(character, location):
    # Create a story based on the character and location provided by the user
    story = f"Once upon a time, in {location}, there lived a brave {character}.\n"
    story += "One day, they decided to embark on an adventure.\n"
    story += "What happens next? Let's find out!\n"
    return story

# Get user input for the character and location
character = input("Enter the name of your character: ")
location = input("Enter a magical place: ")

# Print the story
print(tell_story(_____, _____))  # Fill in the blanks with the character and location
```

### 3. Hints
- **Hint for Problem Statement**: Think about how your favorite stories or games could be transformed into coding projects. What characters or settings would engage kids? Consider projects like creating a digital comic strip or an interactive game where players make choices.
  
- **Hint for Fill-in-the-Blank Code**: Remember that the function `tell_story` takes two parameters: `character` and `location`. You need to pass these variables when calling the function in the print statement.

### 4. Expected Outcome
Students should be able to brainstorm creative project ideas that effectively integrate storytelling with coding concepts, demonstrating their understanding of Project-Based Learning (PBL). They should also successfully fill in the blanks in the provided code, showcasing their ability to apply what they've learned about defining functions and using input in Python.

The final solution should:
- Include well-defined project ideas with clear objectives.
- Correctly fill in the blanks with appropriate variables.
- Be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, reflecting best practices in coding and teaching.

## Integration
This exercise is designed to engage students in critical thinking while allowing them to apply concepts discussed in the lecture on Project-Based Learning. The structure is clear, with headings and sections that facilitate easy understanding and navigation. The exercise encourages creativity and collaboration, aligning with your goals as an EdTech tutor focused on making learning fun and interactive for kids.
