### Module Title: Project-Based Learning in Coding

### Exercise Requirements

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   You are tasked with creating a project plan for an educational coding project aimed at kids aged 8-15. The project should incorporate storytelling elements to enhance engagement and creativity, as discussed in the lecture on Project-Based Learning (PBL). Consider the following scenario:

   **Scenario**: You want to develop a coding project where students create their own interactive story using a platform like Scratch. The project should encourage collaboration, critical thinking, and personal expression. 

   **Instructions**:
   - Outline the project objectives.
   - Describe the steps students will take to complete the project.
   - Identify the skills they will develop during the process.
   - Consider how you will assess their work and provide feedback.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**:
   Below is a starter code snippet for creating an interactive story in Scratch. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality. 

   ```scratch
   # Starter code for implementing storytelling concepts
   when green flag clicked
   say [Welcome to my story!] for 2 seconds
   wait 1 second
   say [What would you like to do next?] for 2 seconds
   # Options for user interaction
   choose_option = [Option A, Option B, Option C]
   
   if choose_option = "Option A" then
       say [You chose A! Let's go on an adventure!] for 2 seconds
       # Continue the story here
   else if choose_option = "Option B" then
       say [You chose B! A different path awaits!] for 2 seconds
       # Continue the story here
   else
       say [You chose C! An unexpected twist!] for 2 seconds
       # Continue the story here
   ```

3. **Hints**:
   - Think about how you can use conditional statements to allow users to make choices that affect the story's outcome.
   - Use the `say` block to narrate different parts of the story based on user selections.
   - Ensure that each option leads to a unique continuation of the story, enhancing the interactive experience.

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   By completing this exercise, students should be able to:
   - Create a project plan that outlines objectives, steps, skills developed, and assessment methods.
   - Fill in the blanks in the starter code to create an interactive storytelling experience.
   - Demonstrate an understanding of how storytelling can be integrated into coding projects to enhance engagement and creativity.

### Integration 
- Ensure that this exercise is presented in a clear, structured format with headings and bullet points for easy navigation.
- Utilize markdown formatting for clarity and include links to additional resources on PBL and coding with Scratch, if available. 

### Example Project Plan Outline:
- **Project Title**: Interactive Story Adventure
- **Objectives**:
  - Develop coding skills using Scratch.
  - Enhance creativity through storytelling.
  - Foster collaboration by working in pairs or small groups.
- **Steps**:
  1. Brainstorm story ideas and choose a theme.
  2. Create characters and settings using Scratch tools.
  3. Write dialogue and plot points for the story.
  4. Code the interactions and choices using Scratch.
  5. Test and refine the project based on peer feedback.
- **Skills Developed**:
  - Coding logic and syntax in Scratch.
  - Creative writing and storytelling techniques.
  - Collaboration and communication skills.
- **Assessment**:
  - Peer reviews of projects based on creativity, engagement, and coding accuracy.
  - Self-reflection on what they learned during the project.

This exercise aligns with your goal of creating captivating educational projects for kids while enhancing your skills in learning experience design and storytelling.
