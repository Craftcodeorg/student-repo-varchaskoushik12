### Lecture: What is Project-Based Learning?

#### 1. Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lecture, learners will be able to:
- Define Project-Based Learning (PBL) and explain its significance in education.
- Identify the key components of PBL and how it can be applied in teaching coding to kids.
- Recognize the benefits of integrating storytelling into PBL to enhance engagement and understanding.

#### 2. Introduction:
Project-Based Learning (PBL) is an educational approach that empowers students to learn by engaging in real-world projects. This method is particularly important in teaching coding for kids, as it fosters creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration—skills essential for future success in technology and beyond.

For someone interested in storytelling and learning experience design, PBL offers a unique opportunity to weave narratives into coding projects, making learning more relatable and exciting for young learners. By incorporating storytelling elements, educators can create immersive experiences that captivate children's imaginations while they learn coding concepts.

#### 3. Core Concepts:
- **Definition of Project-Based Learning**: PBL is an instructional methodology where students gain knowledge and skills by working on a project over an extended period. This approach encourages active exploration and hands-on learning.
  
- **Key Components of PBL**:
  - **Real-World Connection**: Projects are often based on real-world problems or questions, making learning relevant and engaging.
  - **Student Voice and Choice**: Learners have the autonomy to make decisions about their projects, fostering ownership and motivation.
  - **Collaboration**: Students work together, developing teamwork skills essential for both coding and storytelling.
  - **Reflection**: Continuous reflection helps students evaluate their learning processes and outcomes.

- **Importance in Teaching Coding**: PBL helps demystify coding concepts by allowing kids to create tangible products (like games or apps) that they can share with others. This hands-on approach not only makes coding more accessible but also enhances problem-solving skills.

#### 4. Practical Application:
One real-world example of PBL in action is a classroom project where students create a simple interactive story using coding platforms like Scratch. In this project, students can:
- Develop a storyline with characters and settings.
- Use coding blocks to animate their story, incorporating user interactions.

**Simple Code Snippet Example** (in Scratch):
```scratch
when green flag clicked
say [Welcome to my story!] for 2 seconds
move 10 steps
if <mouse down?> then
    say [You clicked me!] for 2 seconds
end
```
This snippet introduces basic coding concepts while allowing students to express their creativity through storytelling.

#### 5. Summary:
In this lecture, we explored the fundamentals of Project-Based Learning and its relevance in teaching coding to kids. Key takeaways include:
- PBL engages students through real-world projects that foster creativity and collaboration.
- Integrating storytelling into PBL enhances student engagement and makes coding concepts more relatable.
- The approach supports critical thinking and problem-solving skills essential for young coders.

#### 6. Next Steps:
In the next lecture, we will delve deeper into the design process of a PBL project specifically tailored for teaching coding to kids. We will discuss how to structure a project from inception to completion while incorporating elements of storytelling effectively.

To prepare, consider brainstorming a simple project idea that combines coding with a story you would like to tell. This will help you actively engage with the upcoming material and apply what you’ve learned about PBL.
