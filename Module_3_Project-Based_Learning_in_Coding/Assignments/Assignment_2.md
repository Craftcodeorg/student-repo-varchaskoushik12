### Assignment: Create an Interactive Coding Project to Teach Children About Different Cultures

#### Problem Statement:
Design an interactive coding project that allows children to explore and learn about different cultures through storytelling and coding. The project should engage kids aged 8-15 by allowing them to create a simple interactive story or game that highlights cultural elements such as traditions, foods, languages, or festivals. This assignment leverages the principles of Project-Based Learning (PBL) discussed in the lecture, focusing on engagement, creativity, and storytelling.

#### Starter Code:
Below is a basic framework using Scratch (or similar block-based coding platforms) to get students started on creating their interactive cultural story. The starter code introduces the main character and sets the stage for the interactive experience.

```scratch
// Starter code for an interactive cultural story

when green flag clicked
say [Welcome to our cultural adventure!] for 2 seconds
wait 1 second

// Introduce the main character
say [I am your guide, and today we'll explore the wonderful culture of [insert culture here]! What's your name?] for 3 seconds

// Ask for user input
ask [What's your name?] and wait
set [userName v] to (answer)

// Use the user's name in the story
say (join [Nice to meet you, ] (userName)) for 2 seconds
wait 1 second

// Start the cultural exploration
say [Let's discover some amazing traditions together!] for 2 seconds
```

#### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Step 1: Personalize the Story**
   - Modify the starter code to allow children to select a culture they want to learn about. Create a list of cultures (e.g., Japanese, Indian, Mexican) and use a menu or buttons for selection.
   - Update the introduction to include the selected culture in the dialogue.

2. **Step 2: Add Cultural Elements**
   - Research and include at least three cultural elements related to the selected culture. This could be a traditional dish, a festival, or a unique custom.
   - For each element, create a scene or dialogue that describes it. Use visuals and sounds to make it more engaging.

3. **Step 3: Interactive Questions**
   - Incorporate interactive questions throughout the story that ask users about their knowledge of the culture. For example, "What do you think is a popular dish in [selected culture]?"
   - Allow users to select answers from multiple choices, and provide feedback based on their selections.

4. **Step 4: Final Touches**
   - Add animations or sounds that relate to the culture being explored. For example, if exploring Indian culture, you might include traditional music or dance animations.
   - Ensure that transitions between scenes are smooth and engaging.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
- **Engagement**: The project should captivate the target audience with an interesting storyline and interactive elements.
- **Creativity**: The use of visuals, sounds, and storytelling should be creative and culturally accurate.
- **Functionality**: The interactive elements (questions, choices) should work seamlessly within the project.
- **Code Quality**: The code should be well-organized and commented, demonstrating good coding practices.

**Rubric:**
- **Engagement (30 points)**: How well does the project engage users?
- **Creativity (30 points)**: Are the cultural elements presented in an innovative way?
- **Functionality (20 points)**: Do all interactive elements function as intended?
- **Code Quality (20 points)**: Is the code clean, well-organized, and documented?

This assignment aligns with your goal of creating captivating projects for kids while enhancing their coding skills through real-world applications. It emphasizes storytelling in coding, making learning both fun and educational.
