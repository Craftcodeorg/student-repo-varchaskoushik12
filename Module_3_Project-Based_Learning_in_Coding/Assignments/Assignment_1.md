# Project-Based Learning in Coding: Assignment

## Assignment Title: Create an Interactive Coding Project on Environmental Awareness

### Problem Statement:
As a coding tutor for kids, your task is to develop an interactive project that teaches children aged 8-15 about environmental awareness through coding. This project should not only engage students but also encourage them to think critically about environmental issues while learning coding concepts. 

The project will involve creating a simple game or interactive story using a coding platform such as Scratch or Python with Pygame, where players must make choices that impact the environment positively or negatively. 

### Starter Code:
Below is a basic framework in Scratch that sets up an interactive story about recycling. You will expand upon this code to include more interactive elements and educational content.

```scratch
when green flag clicked
say [Welcome to the Recycling Adventure!] for 2 seconds
say [Help us save the environment by making the right choices!] for 3 seconds

// Define options for the user
ask [What would you like to recycle? (Plastic, Paper, Glass)] and wait
if <answer = [Plastic]> then
    say [Great choice! Plastic can be recycled into new products.] for 3 seconds
    // Add more interactions here
else if <answer = [Paper]> then
    say [Good job! Recycling paper helps save trees.] for 3 seconds
    // Add more interactions here
else if <answer = [Glass]> then
    say [Nice! Glass can be recycled indefinitely.] for 3 seconds
    // Add more interactions here
else 
    say [That's not a valid option. Try again!] for 2 seconds
end
```

### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Enhance the Storyline**:
   - Expand the storyline by adding characters that guide the player through the recycling process.
   - Create scenarios where players can choose different items to recycle and see the outcomes of their choices.

2. **Add More Interactions**:
   - Implement additional questions or quizzes about environmental facts after each recycling choice.
   - Use Scratch's broadcasting feature to create different scenes based on user choices.

3. **Visual Elements**:
   - Include images or animations that illustrate the recycling process for each item.
   - Use sound effects or background music to make the experience more engaging.

4. **Reflection Component**:
   - At the end of the game, prompt users to reflect on what they learned about recycling and its importance.
   - Allow them to share their score or achievements with friends or family.

### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
To successfully complete this assignment, ensure that:
- The interactive project effectively teaches children about environmental awareness through engaging storytelling and coding.
- The code is clean, well-structured, and includes comments explaining each part of the code.
- The project includes multiple user interactions that provide educational feedback.
- The final product is visually appealing and user-friendly, encouraging kids to explore and learn.

### Submission Guidelines:
- Submit your completed project link (if using an online platform like Scratch) or a zip file containing your project files (if using Python).
- Include a short reflection (200-300 words) on how this project incorporates storytelling and what you learned about Project-Based Learning in coding.

By completing this assignment, you will not only enhance your coding skills but also create an engaging educational tool that aligns with your career goals in EdTech.
