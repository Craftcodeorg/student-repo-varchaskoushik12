# Module Title: Project-Based Learning in Coding

## Example 2: Creating a Virtual Pet Game

### 1. Introduction
Creating a Virtual Pet Game serves as an excellent example of Project-Based Learning (PBL) in the context of coding education for children. This project not only aligns with the benefits of PBL discussed in the lecture but also engages kids in a fun, interactive way that promotes creativity and problem-solving. By integrating storytelling into coding, educators can make abstract concepts tangible and relatable, ultimately enhancing the learning experience for kids aged 8-15. This project is particularly significant in the EdTech space as it combines technical skills with engaging content, making learning more captivating.

### 2. Code Snippet
Here is a well-commented code snippet for creating a simple Virtual Pet Game using Python. This example includes error handling and follows best practices for coding.

```python
class VirtualPet:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.happiness = 5  # Happiness level from 1 to 10
        self.hunger = 5     # Hunger level from 1 to 10

    def feed(self):
        if self.hunger < 10:
            self.hunger += 1
            print(f"{self.name} has been fed! Hunger level is now {self.hunger}.")
        else:
            print(f"{self.name} is not hungry!")

    def play(self):
        if self.happiness < 10:
            self.happiness += 1
            print(f"{self.name} played! Happiness level is now {self.happiness}.")
        else:
            print(f"{self.name} is already very happy!")

    def status(self):
        print(f"{self.name}'s Happiness: {self.happiness}, Hunger: {self.hunger}")

# Main program execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pet_name = input("What do you want to name your pet? ")
    my_pet = VirtualPet(pet_name)

    while True:
        action = input("Do you want to feed, play, or check status of your pet? (Type 'exit' to quit) ").lower()
        if action == 'feed':
            my_pet.feed()
        elif action == 'play':
            my_pet.play()
        elif action == 'status':
            my_pet.status()
        elif action == 'exit':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid action! Please choose 'feed', 'play', or 'status'.")
```

### 3. Explanation
- **Class Definition**: The `VirtualPet` class encapsulates the properties and behaviors of a virtual pet. It has attributes for `name`, `happiness`, and `hunger`, allowing for easy tracking of the pet's state.
  
- **Methods**: 
  - `feed()`: Increases the hunger level while ensuring it does not exceed the maximum limit. This method teaches kids about conditional statements and limits.
  - `play()`: Similar to `feed()`, this method increases happiness and reinforces the idea of managing different states.
  - `status()`: Displays the current happiness and hunger levels, helping kids learn about output and user interaction.

- **Main Program Execution**: 
  - The program prompts the user to name their pet and interact with it through feeding, playing, or checking its status. Error handling is incorporated by validating user input, which is crucial in real-world applications to prevent crashes.

### 4. Application
The concept of creating a Virtual Pet Game can be applied in various ways within EdTech. For instance, it addresses common challenges such as:

- **Engagement**: By allowing children to create and interact with their own virtual pets, they remain engaged and motivated to learn coding concepts.
- **Creativity**: Kids can customize their pets and choose different actions, fostering creativity while learning.
- **Problem-Solving**: As they encounter issues (e.g., pet not responding), they learn to troubleshoot their code and think critically about solutions.

This project not only teaches coding skills but also integrates soft skills such as empathy (caring for a virtual pet) and responsibility (managing the pet's needs), making it a holistic educational tool.
