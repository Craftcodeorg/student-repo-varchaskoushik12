# Assignment: Create an Interactive Story with Choices

### Problem Statement
In this assignment, you will develop a short interactive story where characters make choices that influence the outcome of the narrative. This task directly applies the concepts of coding as a literacy skill and enhancing problem-solving skills discussed in the lecture on the importance of coding in education. The story should engage children aged 8-15, allowing them to explore different paths based on their choices, thereby fostering creativity and critical thinking.

### Starter Code
Below is a basic framework using pseudocode similar to Scratch. You will build upon this starter code to create your interactive story.

```plaintext
When green flag clicked
Set character position to (0,0)
Say "Welcome to my adventure!" for 2 seconds
Ask "Do you want to go on a quest or stay home?" and wait

If answer = "quest" then
    Say "Great! You are off to find a hidden treasure!" for 2 seconds
    Ask "Do you want to take the forest path or the mountain path?" and wait
    If answer = "forest" then
        Say "You encounter a friendly dragon!" for 2 seconds
    Else
        Say "You find an ancient castle!" for 2 seconds
    End
Else
    Say "You decide to relax at home." for 2 seconds
End
```

### Detailed Instructions
1. **Step 1**: Modify the initial greeting to include a character name. Prompt the user to enter their name at the beginning of the story.
   - Example: `Ask "What is your name?" and wait`
   - Use the response to personalize the story: `Say "Welcome, [name]! Let's begin our adventure!"`

2. **Step 2**: Expand the choices after the initial question. Add at least two more options after the player chooses to go on a quest.
   - For example, after choosing "quest," add options like "help a villager" or "explore a cave."

3. **Step 3**: Create different outcomes based on the new choices. Each option should lead to a unique scenario that engages the player.
   - Example: If they choose "help a villager," respond with a scenario where they save someone from danger.

4. **Step 4**: Ensure that every choice leads to a conclusion. After each scenario, provide an option to restart the story or exit.
   - Example: After encountering the dragon, say "What do you want to do next? Restart or Exit?"

5. **Step 5**: Add visual elements or sound effects if your platform allows it. This will enhance the interactive experience.

### Criteria for Success and Evaluation
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Functionality**: The interactive story runs without errors and all choices lead to appropriate outcomes.
- **Creativity**: The scenarios are imaginative and engaging for children aged 8-15.
- **Code Quality**: The code is well-structured, easy to read, and follows best practices (e.g., clear variable names, comments explaining sections).
- **User Experience**: The story is user-friendly, with clear prompts and options for users to follow.

### Submission Guidelines
- Submit your completed interactive story as a link to your project on Scratch or another suitable platform.
- Include a brief reflection (200 words) on how you integrated coding concepts into your storytelling project.

This assignment not only reinforces your coding skills but also aligns with your career goal of teaching coding in an engaging manner, contributing significantly to your portfolio of educational projects for kids. Happy coding!
