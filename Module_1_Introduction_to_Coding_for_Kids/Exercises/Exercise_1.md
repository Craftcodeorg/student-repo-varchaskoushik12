### Module Title: Introduction to Coding for Kids

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement
**Scenario**: You are tasked with creating a simple animation using Scratch that tells an interactive story about a character who embarks on an adventure to find a lost treasure. The character should respond to user inputs, making the story engaging and dynamic. Your animation should incorporate elements discussed in the lecture, such as coding definitions, the importance of coding, and basic components of coding languages.

**Task**: 
- Create an animation where the character introduces itself and invites the user to join in the adventure.
- Allow the user to click on different objects in the scene to reveal parts of the story or to ask questions that the character will answer.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
**Scratch Starter Code**:
```scratch
// Starter code for implementing interactive storytelling in Scratch

when green flag clicked
say "Hello! I'm _______! Let's go on an adventure!" for 2 seconds

when this sprite clicked
say "Click on the treasure chest to see what I found!" for 2 seconds

when treasure chest clicked
say "I found a magical map!" for 2 seconds
```
*Instructions*: Fill in the blank with a character name of your choice. You can also expand on the storyline by adding more interactive elements.

#### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1**: Think about how you can use different sprites to represent characters and objects in your story. Each sprite can have its own set of interactions.
- **Hint 2**: Remember to use the `say` block to allow your character to communicate with the user. This is a great way to make your story feel alive!
- **Hint 3**: Consider how you can incorporate variables to track user choices or responses throughout the animation.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Create a simple yet engaging animation that utilizes coding concepts discussed in the lecture.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how coding can be used for storytelling by allowing user interaction.
- Showcase your ability to implement basic components of coding languages, such as sprites, events, and dialogue in Scratch.

The final animation should be interactive, well-structured, and clearly demonstrate how coding can enhance storytelling. Remember to include comments in your Scratch project explaining what each part of your code does, reinforcing your understanding of coding principles.

### Integration
This exercise can be integrated into your learning platform as follows:
- **Title**: Interactive Storytelling with Scratch
- **Description**: Create a simple animation that tells a story and engages users through interactivity.
- **Resources**: Link to Scratch tutorial videos and documentation for further assistance.

This exercise aligns with your goals of teaching coding for kids and focuses on making learning fun and interactive through storytelling. Happy coding!
