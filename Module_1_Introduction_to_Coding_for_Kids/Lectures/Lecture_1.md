# Lecture: What is Coding?

## 1. Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lecture, learners will be able to:
- Define coding and explain its significance in the digital world.
- Identify the basic components of coding languages.
- Recognize how coding can be used to tell stories and create engaging narratives.

## 2. Introduction:
Coding, at its core, is the process of creating instructions that a computer can understand and execute. It is essential for developing software, websites, and applications that shape our digital experiences. For aspiring educators in coding, understanding what coding is lays the foundation for teaching kids how to express their creativity through technology.

As someone interested in storytelling and learning experience design, you will find that coding is not just about writing lines of text; itâ€™s about crafting interactive narratives and engaging experiences. This lecture will connect the dots between coding and storytelling, highlighting how these skills can empower young learners to create their own digital stories.

## 3. Core Concepts:
### A. Definition of Coding
- **Coding**: The act of writing instructions in a programming language that a computer can interpret to perform specific tasks.
  
### B. Importance of Coding
- Coding is fundamental to technology; it drives everything from simple apps to complex systems.
- It enhances problem-solving skills and logical thinking, which are crucial for both math and storytelling.

### C. Basic Components of Coding Languages
- **Syntax**: The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs.
- **Variables**: Containers for storing data values (e.g., `storyTitle = "The Adventures of Coding"`).
- **Functions**: Blocks of code designed to perform particular tasks (e.g., a function to display a story).

## 4. Practical Application:
### Example 1: Interactive Storytelling
In platforms like Scratch, kids can use coding to create interactive stories where characters respond to user inputs. For instance, they can code a character to say different lines based on what the user clicks.

### Code Snippet:
```scratch
when this sprite clicked
say "Welcome to my story!" for 2 seconds
```
This simple code allows the character to introduce itself when clicked, engaging users in a narrative.

### Example 2: Math Games
Coding can also be used to develop educational games that reinforce math concepts through storytelling. For example, creating a game where players solve math problems to help a character complete a quest.

## 5. Summary:
In summary, coding is a powerful tool that allows individuals to create and control digital experiences. It is essential for teaching kids how to express their creativity through technology while enhancing their problem-solving abilities. Key takeaways include understanding what coding is, its components, and its applications in storytelling and education.

## 6. Next Steps:
In the next lecture, we will explore different programming languages suitable for kids and how they can be used to create engaging projects. To prepare, consider thinking about a story you would like to tell through code or a simple game idea that incorporates math concepts. This will help you apply what you learn in the upcoming session!
