Create an interactive coding game called "Math Quest," where players embark on an adventure to solve math puzzles and challenges to progress through different levels. The game should incorporate storytelling elements, colorful characters, and engaging visuals to captivate children aged 8-15. The project will demonstrate your skills in coding, learning experience design, and storytelling while providing an educational and fun experience for kids.
